EXPLANATION

1.State Initialization:
The useState hook initializes the contact state as an object with three properties: fName, lName, and email.

2.Dynamic State Updates:
The "handleChange" function dynamically updates the state based on the name attribute of the input field being edited.

3.Form and Inputs:
The form contains three input fields for fName, lName, and email. Each input has an onChange handler that triggers the handleChange function to update the state.

4.Rendering State:
The contact state is displayed dynamically in the <h1> and <p> elements, reflecting the user's input in real-time.
This code demonstrates how to manage and update a complex state object in React efficiently.
